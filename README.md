# React GitHub Repo Search App with Bookmark Feature

![GitHub Repo Search App Screenshot](screenshot.png)

This is a simple React application that allows users to search for GitHub repositories and bookmark their favorite ones. The app uses React Context to manage the state of the searched repositories and the bookmarked repositories, and it utilizes local storage to persist the bookmarked repositories across sessions. Additionally, the app provides toast messages for user feedback and alerts for error handling.

## Features

- **GitHub Repo Search:** Users can enter a GitHub username and search for repositories associated with that user. The app will display a list of matching repositories with details like the repository name, owner, and description.

- **Bookmarking:** Users can click on the bookmark icon to add a repository to their bookmarks. Bookmarked repositories are stored in local storage, allowing users to access them even after closing the app or refreshing the page.

- **Toast Messages:** The app displays toast messages to provide feedback to users. For example, when a repository is successfully bookmarked, a toast message will appear confirming the action.

- **Alerts:** In case of errors or issues, the app shows alert messages to notify users. For instance, if a user tries to bookmark a repository that is already bookmarked, an alert will be displayed to prevent duplication.
